# Git Stages:
Unstaged files (Working directory) -> Staged Files (Staging area/index => tracked files) -> Commited (Local Repository - .git directory) -> Remote Area

1. git add
2. git commit
3. git push origin master

* Initial commit -> root-commit

## Starting a new project:
# 1. Starting with a fresh project (no source yet):
git init <project-name> -> git add -> git commit -> git remote add
* Here, 'git init' creates a new directory and initializes an empty '.git' repository in it.
$ git remote add origin <repo-url>

# 2. Adding git to an existing project:
git init -> git add . -> git commit -m "first commit"
* Here, 'git init' initializes an empty '.git' repository in the current directory.

# 3. Joining an existing remote project:
git clone <Project-URL> ->

* status: Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master' => master branch on the remote repostory (origin is a refer to the remote)

## Adding files:
git add . -> git commit -> git pull origin master -> git push origin master
* Best practice: doing pull before push to sync (If we have multiple contributors on that repository)

$ git commit -am <commit-message>
* Add any changes into staging area and then commiting directly.

$ git ls-files
* Show information about files in the index (or staging area) and the working tree (unless they have been deleted or modified in a way that Git hasn't yet registered and the changes are unstaged).
