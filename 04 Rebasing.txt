$ git rebase <source-branch>
Consider what happens when you start working on a new feature in a dedicated branch,
then another team member updates the main branch (the source branch) with new commits.
This moves the entire feature branch to begin on the tip of the source branch,
effectively incorporating all of the new commits in main.

* If we have a rebasing conflict:
** We can abort that rebase.
$ git rebase --abort
** or We can resolve the conflict and:
$ git rebase --continue

$ git pull --rebase origin master
Pull with rebase. When we have some changes in remote,
then our local changes are reapplied on top of the remote changes.
